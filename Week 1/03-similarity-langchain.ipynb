       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'un/TXT/Session 77 - 2022/TCD_77_2022.txt'}, page_content='At the outset, I congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session and wish him every success in conducting its work. I also pay tribute to Mr. Abdulla Shahid, the outgoing President of the General Assembly, for the dynamism with which he led the work of the seventy-sixth session. I further commend Secretary- General Antonio Guterres and wish him every success at this difficult time of multiple and complex crises throughout the world. We reiterate to him Chad’s full friendship and support.\\nThe seventy-seventh session, whose theme is “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, is taking place at a time when humankind is facing a multitude of challenges unprecedented since the creation of our Organization. They are serious, complex and successive challenges to our collective efforts and difficult to address. The current international order, based on the Charter of the United Nations, is being severely tested, for instance, by the geopolitical tensions in several parts of our planet, including those caused by the ongoing war in Ukraine, with its impact on the affected civilian populations and on the entire world at the economic, food security and energy supply levels.\\nOne of the difficult experiences we have faced was the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that plunged our lives into a state of great upheaval. Today the world is struggling to recover from the shock of COVID-19. We have lived through that unprecedented challenge, enduring the loss of millions of human lives and its adverse health, social and economic consequences. The recent lull in the situation should not lead us to relax; rather, it should prompt us to further consolidate the multilateral cooperation we witnessed when States and organizations came together and supported each other to overcome the scourge. We hope to see a further consolidation of that multilateral cooperation, particularly in addressing other persistent and recurrent crises and challenges such as wars, terrorism, climate change, health and food crises and poverty.\\nThis session is therefore an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and to reiterate our collective commitment to realizing them, in particular through the implementation of the recommendations made in the declaration on the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations (resolution 75/1). The time has come to take practical measures to achieve those objectives by correcting the many mistakes that have led to the recurrent problems hindering the work of the international community and preventing the full realization of the promises contained in the Charter.\\nIn that regard, the Secretary-General’s Our Common Agenda initiative, which is an action plan aimed at strengthening and accelerating the implementation of multilateral agreements, in particular the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and making a concrete difference in the lives of people, is particularly welcome. It is indeed an important step in the right direction. Chad fully supports the initiative and hopes that it will lead to the promotion, strengthening and prioritization of multiple concrete solutions to the major challenges of our time and have a real impact on the lives of the people, particularly those in poor countries, rather than being a sham of multilateralism that is limited only to lengthy statements that have no real effect.\\nIn that regard, it is clear that seven years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and three years since its proclamation here in New York, the results of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals are still far from being achieved, especially for poor countries. As the Secretary-General’s reports on that issue have mentioned, those goals will not be met, and many people will be left behind, if bold action is not taken. Unfortunately, a downward spiral may be set off and cause disappointment in the hearts of millions of people around the world. That is why, in the wake of the declaration on the commemoration of the seventy- fifth anniversary of the United Nations, the Secretary- General’s Our Common Agenda initiative gives us hope that our legitimate expectations regarding international agreements and programmes, first and foremost the 2030 Agenda, can be realized.\\nAll our actions converge towards sustainable development, but development is only possible where there is lasting peace and security. That is why the efforts of our States to achieve those objectives require increased and continuous support. The international commitments made to that effect through the 2030 Agenda, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the New Urban Agenda and all other international agendas must be honoured if we are to achieve the ultimate goal of ensuring that no one is left behind and having a planet that is fit to live on and can be passed on safely and proudly to succeeding generations.\\nTo that end, in the face of mounting and accumulating challenges, it is crucial to strengthen the existing commitments made by virtue of the indispensable solidarity that binds our States together, especially the rich and the poor, through development assistance, on the one hand, and the implementation of economic and financial empowerment mechanisms, as well as sustainable development policies in favour of the least developed and landlocked developing countries, on the other.\\nDespite geopolitical emergencies and various constraints, any approach or attempt to limit development aid would be counterproductive and could increase crisis situations in the world. Chad therefore calls on donor countries to maintain and increase development assistance through the United Nations, which provides unlimited assistance to hundreds of millions of people around the world whose very survival depends on it.\\nI cannot but also mention the issue of debt, which continues to place an unbearable burden on many developing countries, including Chad. That burden constitutes a real problem, hampering post-COVID-19 recovery, economic recovery and the implementation of sustainable development programmes. Debt relief therefore remains an urgent need to promote economic recovery in low-income countries and reverse the gloomy outlook for the global economy. From that perspective, Chad reiterates its commitment to the various needs and initiatives to cancel or restructure the debt of developing countries. I also want to call for the swift implementation of the facilities granted to my country, Chad, within the framework of the initiatives that various multilateral bodies have taken in order to enable us to respond to the pressing needs of our people, who already face the accumulating challenges of economy, humanitarian emergencies, insecurity caused by terrorist threats, the negative effects of climate change, the food crisis and others.\\nRegarding the political situation in my country, as the General Assembly knows, we have been undergoing a period of political transition since 20 April 2021. I can tell everyone now that the transitional process is progressing satisfactorily. The Transitional Military Council, headed by General Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, and the Transitional Government, are committed to ending that process and achieving lasting peace leading to rebuilding the Chadian State awaited by the Chadian people. Our inclusive and sovereign national dialogue, which is now under way, should lead to the holding of democratic, free and transparent elections. The dialogue brings together all the nation’s active forces and ensures the participation of political and military movements, made possible thanks to the Doha agreement signed on 8 August.\\nI take this opportunity to express from this rostrum the deep gratitude of the Government and the people of Chad to the Government of the State of Qatar, headed by His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad A1 Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, who kindly hosted and facilitated the pre-dialogue between the Government of Chad and the political and military groups. The inclusive and sovereign national dialogue, in which all segments of the Chadian society participate — including political parties, civil society, politicians, military staff, professional organizations, women, youth, people with special needs, expatriates, civil and religious leaders, defence and security forces and others — is a historic opportunity for Chadians to decide, in full sovereignty, how to rebuild their country.\\nParticipants in the dialogue have discussed all issues related to the future of Chad in complete honesty, freedom and sovereignty. The outcome of the dialogue will be implemented and binding on all. Chad is counting on its partners to support and finance the implementation of the dialogue’s ensuing decisions and recommendations. Of course, some have opted not to take part in that historic dialogue. Endeavours are being undertaken to persuading those brothers and sisters to reconsider their choice and join the dialogue.\\nIn terms of security and development, the situation in the Sahel and the Lake Chad region has become extremely worrisome and continues to deteriorate due to many factors, including institutional changes in many countries of the region, the dismantling of military counter-terrorism units, the effects of climate change leading to increased food insecurity due to the lack of an appropriate response, uncontrolled illegal migration and unchecked growth in illicit trafficking.\\nWith regard to the security situation, we note the resurgence of terrorist activities in the Sahel, which has been relentless in its spread to neighbouring regions in West Africa, especially Togo, Burkina Faso and Benin, where terrorist attacks have taken place. In the light of the continued deterioration of the situation, Chad has continuously called for a new approach to the situation in the Sahel so as to better adapt our responses.\\nIn that regard, Chad welcomes the initiative of the United Nations and the African Union, in partnership with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel) to conduct a joint strategic assessment of the situation in the Sahel and the appointment of the former President of the Niger, His Excellency Mr. Mahamadou Issoufou, to head the Independent High-level Panel on Security and Development in the Sahel, responsible for conducting the assessment. We have no doubt that President Issoufou and his team will carry out an in-depth analysis of the problems plaguing the subregion and propose solutions to help us readapt the response to a multidimensional crisis that, despite the solutions already implemented, continues to deteriorate year after year.\\nIt is true that the Sahel does not lack strategies or plans to address the crisis. The States of the Sahel and their bilateral and multilateral partners have implemented measures that have been in place for almost 20 years, with results that have fallen short of our expectations. The strategic assessment will therefore enable us to understand the causes, although we already know that the terrorism which is spilling blood in the Sahel cannot be defeated without the restoration of peace and State authority in Libya.\\nThe many initiatives adopted by Member States at the national and subregional levels continue to suffer greatly from the lack of adequate resources for their implementation. The G-5 Sahel Joint Force, for example, is struggling to find sustainable and predictable resources to carry out its activities adequately. That is why Chad once again calls on its partners to support the G-5 Sahel in order to prevent the region from plunging deeper into violence and chaos. I reiterate the call of the G-5 Sahel Heads of State for sustainable and predictable funding from United Nations assessed contributions for the Joint Force.\\nWith regard to the internal situation of the G-5 Sahel, it has seen the withdrawal of the sisterly Republic of Mali. We regret that withdrawal, as Mali was a founding member of the organization. Its place will be preserved. We will not be able to defeat terrorism or achieve stability and development in the Sahel unless we all join the struggle and pool our capabilities. We hope that our Malian brothers will reconsider their decision and rejoin our joint organization. The door of the G-5 Sahel remains wide open to them.\\nWith regard to the situation in Libya, Chad is concerned about the persistence of the political impasse related to the clashes that took place in Tripoli on 26 and 27 August. Chad once again urges the Libyan political actors to prioritize dialogue in order to end the ongoing crisis and continue implementing the agreed elections agenda. Chad encourages the international community, in particular the United Nations and the African Union, to pursue efforts to bring the positions of the various parties to the conflict closer together and foster political dialogue, as the Libyan crisis will be resolved only through peaceful means and a Libyan-led inclusive political dialogue.\\nThe persistence of the conflict in Libya poses a permanent threat to neighbouring countries and the entire Sahel region, for which Chad has paid and continues to pay a heavy price. In that regard, Chad once again reiterates its call on the Security Council and the Secretary-General to implement the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process, which represents a lasting solution to the issue of its nationals engaged with the various Libyan military factions.\\nWith regard to Cuba, Chad calls for the lifting of the economic and trade embargo imposed by the United States Government on that country, which continues to weigh heavily on the lives of its people.\\nConcerning the reform of the Security Council—the organ responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security — Chad once again urges Member States to move from talk to action on implementing that reform and lifting the historical injustice against the African continent, which excludes it from full and fair participation in that organ. In that regard, Chad will continue to fully support the Common African Position, as set forth in the Sirte Declaration and other relevant conventions.\\nIn conclusion, I wish the General Assembly every success in carrying out its tasks.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'un/TXT/Session 77 - 2022/SWZ_77_2022.txt'}, page_content='It is a great honour for me to address this seventy-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly, where we have once again come together as a community of nations to renew our commitment to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals.\\nWe are meeting at a time when we have just passed through a period of tragedy brought about by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has claimed lives all over the world. We thank God that this period is subsiding. We must praise the countries of the world for uniting to fight the pandemic up to this point, where it is on the verge of being eradicated. The development and supply of COVID-19 vaccines has proved very useful, especially with regard to prevention interventions. We also applaud the United Nations for being instrumental while working under extremely difficult conditions. It remained resolute in assisting countries, and it is safe to say we are where we are today because of its efforts. Despite those challenges, it is encouraging to think that there have been some positives to take away from that experience. In the case of Eswatini, we were compelled to develop testing laboratories and oxygen storage facilities, which are now very helpful in the fight against other health issues. We have witnessed the importance of the availability of oxygen, which has been used in saving the lives of snakebite victims and in other medical emergencies.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic arrived in the midst of an HIV/AIDS pandemic, which we are still battling, and it affected various programmes that had been put in place. Eswatini has made great strides in the fight against HIV and AIDS. We became a shining example for the continent and the world at large after we attained the 95-95-95 UNAIDS treatment-cascade targets in 2020. We are now focused on ending the AIDS pandemic as a global health threat by 2030. That milestone would never have been possible without the support of the development partners that have been with the country since 1986 when our first AIDS case was announced.\\nIt is unfortunate that even after COVID-19, when we were beginning to say that there was hope, we are now confronted with the conflicts that are going on all over the world. Their consequences include, among other things, a loss of life. Those conflicts and tensions have also contributed significantly to the rise in food prices globally. They are not unique to specific areas, as they persist in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. We hope to see an end to those clashes through peaceful settlements, and we must applaud the United Nations for its efforts to prevent them from escalating. Hopefully, there will be long-lasting and fruitful results emerging from the interventions of the United Nations. As we gather here in this Hall, we are all reminded of the main purpose of the Organization’s establishment, which was to reduce the tensions that lead to conflict around the world. We hope the aspirations of our forefathers will guide us in using the Organization to bring us together, so that we can resolve our differences where they exist and find lasting solutions. That will unquestionably be of great help to all humankind.\\nThose problems are a setback to the ongoing efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), given the negative impact of COVID-19 and the fact that various conflicts are also taking their own toll on those programmes. During the pandemic we witnessed the collapse of many economies, industry shutdowns and disrupted poverty alleviation projects that could not be implemented properly owing to the pandemic prevention measures. That meant that there was no movement of people or goods. Nevertheless, now that COVID-19 is subsiding, it is high time for all of us to once again renew our focus on the SDGs and implement them, as they will play a crucial role in helping our countries develop.\\nWe also note the importance of the role that will have to be played by financial institutions in assisting countries in the recovery process, as most countries suffered a great deal, economically and financially, and are therefore now facing challenges in raising the resources to fund that recovery. We urge our financial institutions to remain open to receiving countries that need support for reviving their developmental programmes and to welcome their requests with sympathy for their plight in the face of the challenges they have encountered in dealing with COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS. We do appreciate that in recent days we have seen the multilateral financial organizations become more welcoming to countries in need of budgetary\\nsupport. We trust that the world will continue to come together to contribute to resolving those challenges, as countries are dealing with great strains on their resources, which they will feel for some time to come.\\nOur theme for the Assembly at its seventy-seventh session is “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”. It fits very well with many of the issues we are facing in the world today. The Kingdom of Eswatini, like all other Member States, has not been immune to encounters that have heightened the pressure on our already stressed economies. They have derailed us from our pursuit of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Aspirations for 2063 — the Africa We Want. The theme should therefore serve to kick-start our economies towards recovery and enable us to create a sustainable future for our people. We in Eswatini are continuing our efforts to attract investment and support small and medium enterprises, as well as to create big industries. In doing so, we are aware of the need for reliable energy sources to help us achieve our investment goals, so that is one of the areas that we are working on developing as a region. We are also focused on remaining highly competitive, which is why we are ranked at the top of the World Bank’s ease of doing business index in Africa when it comes to trading across borders.\\nThe Government has also put in place fiscal support measures to ensure that the costs of establishing businesses and their initial operating costs are drastically reduced through a range of options from fiscal to non-fiscal incentives. The creation of special economic zones has put us at an advantage to leverage our export potential through attracting export-oriented manufacturing projects. Eswatini is also well positioned as a launching pad to the African Continental Free Trade Area which seeks to boost intra-Africa trade with a market of 1.2 billion people and a combined gross domestic product of $2.2 trillion.\\nThe country is also engaged in creating opportunities for our youth to address the issue of unemployment and poverty. There are opportunities to be explored in areas of information and communications technology, agriculture and the informal sector, to name but a few. The Kingdom of Eswatini welcomes the new programme by the United Nations Development Programme to support our youth in Africa who want to engage in entrepreneurship to mitigate the issues of poverty. This is a noble idea, and we are ready to embrace it.\\nFood security and ending hunger remain a priority for the Government of the Kingdom of Eswatini. We are deploying a double-pronged strategy to address this challenge by providing social safety nets for the most vulnerable groups. We have increased budget allocations, engaged in emergency food aid distribution, provided cash transfers to the elderly and vulnerable, and supported school feeding programmes and other support services for disadvantaged populations.\\nWith regard to growth and development in agriculture, the key projects driven by these public investments include the acceleration of water harvesting and irrigation development, where an average of 1,000 hectares is developed with irrigation every year. We are also creating market-linked growth opportunities in agriculture for small and emerging farmers to produce and generate income to enhance their livelihoods.\\nThe negative effects of climate change are compelling the Government to build more dams throughout the Kingdom for irrigation. Other initiatives include the rollout of input subsidies for staple food crops. The combination of these programmes has also increased the production of maize, our staple food, by 30 per cent for the 2021-2022 farming season, only 9 per cent short of our national target.\\nWith global stability at stake, Africans have recognized the need to guard against opportunists who seek to take advantage of fragile economies to advance their agendas. Ours is a history littered with problems of the past and ongoing attempts to reinfiltrate our countries through covert and overt means. Eswatini is of the ardent belief that Africa must have permanent representation in the United Nations Security Council, a call made in the Ezulwini Consensus in 2005. Our position emanates from the fact that every democracy has its particularity and that societies are founded according to different cultural norms and values. We will not tire of the consideration and belated adoption of this call by the United Nations to bring in a proper perspective on the African polity.\\nIt must be noted that, when the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic, no country was spared, which means we all needed to come together to find solutions. Unfortunately, Taiwan was unable to access some of the World Health Organization’s programmes and thereby implement the remedies that required their approval.\\nWe continue to appeal for Taiwan to be considered for full participation in United Nations agencies. We are confident that the global village would benefit substantially from Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the United Nations system. The Kingdom of Eswatini calls upon the United Nations to make the necessary arrangements for Taiwan to significantly participate in relevant United Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms.\\nAs I conclude, Eswatini remains confident in this global body’s ability to confront and overcome the challenges we face because most of them are human- made. We can achieve this through our full commitment to the ideals of the United Nations Charter. At this time, history is calling on each State Member of the United Nations to intensify its efforts to address our plight if we envisage triumphantly walking the path to 2030.\\nHowever, and most importantly, we must remain certain about one crucial thing: our success hinges on unity and respect for one another. Those are the key to all outcomes of this seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly. Despite our diversity, we are one big happy family. We need to give the world and our peoples hope and confidence that the United Nations has the full mandate to play its role in all global issues that affect humankind. May the Almighty God bless us all.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'un/TXT/Session 77 - 2022/NGA_77_2022.txt'}, page_content='On behalf of the Government and the people of Nigeria, I congratulate the President on his well-deserved election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session and assure him of the full support and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation during his tenure. I commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for the Assembly’s many remarkable achievements under his leadership during these challenging times. I would also like to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, on his ceaseless and untiring efforts to promote peace, security and development, which are very much in line with his exalted role.\\nThe first time I might have been able to address the Assembly was in 1984, when I was the Military Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Some 31 years later, in 2016, I had the great privilege to personally address the Assembly as the democratically elected President of my country (see A/71/PV.4 A). As I approach the end of my second and final four- year term, I am reminded of how much has changed in Nigeria, Africa and the world, and yet how some challenges remain. We are now more severely tested by our enduring and our new global challenges, paramount among which are conflicts that are increasingly being driven by non-State actors, the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, terrorism, violent extremism, the malignant use of technology, climate change, irregular migration and disparities in opportunities for improved standards of living.\\nDespite the challenging international environment, the United Nations has proved that it can be strong when the will of its members is harnessed for positive, collective action. The guiding principle of this extraordinary institution is the promotion of peace and security, development and human rights. The latest in a chain of events challenging those principles is the conflict in Ukraine, which has already created strains that may be unprecedented for an entire generation. Such a conflict will have adverse consequences for us all, hindering our capacity to work together to resolve conflicts elsewhere, especially in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Indeed, the ongoing war in Ukraine is making it more difficult to tackle the perennial issues that feature each year in the deliberations of the Assembly, such as nuclear disarmament, the right of Rohingya refugees to return to their homes in Myanmar, Palestinians’ legitimate aspirations for statehood and the reduction of inequalities within and among nations.\\nThe danger that the war in Ukraine will escalate further justifies Nigeria’s resolute calls for a nuclear- free world and a universal Arms Trade Treaty, which are also necessary measures for preventing global human disasters. In that regard, we must find a way to reach a rapid consensus on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, with related commitments by the nuclear-weapon States. I remain firmly convinced that the challenges that have come so sharply into focus in recent years and months emphasize the call by Nigeria and many other Member States for reform of the Security Council and other United Nations agencies. We need a more effective and representative structure to meet today’s demands, which have outgrown a system designed for the very different world that prevailed at its foundation in 1945. Change is long overdue.\\nThis is the first meeting that we are having here in New York without the restrictions that characterized the past three years. The coronavirus disease pandemic ripped across national borders like a toxic whirlwind, leaving in its wake a legacy of pain and loss. Happily, we also witnessed an incredible level of innovation and creativity from those who devised treatments and vaccines. Those laudable achievements were underpinned by partnerships and international cooperation. We also saw the bravery, care and endurance of health professionals in every corner of the globe. With the coronavirus, we saw very clearly how States tried to meet the challenge of a threat that could not be contained within national borders. The results were mixed, but at its best, the cooperation among stakeholders was outstanding. It facilitated solutions that saved countless lives and eased a huge burden of human suffering. That same theme of multilateralism, as the promotion of national interests competes with the common cause in the face of an existential threat, has been our recurring experience in recent times.\\nIn every address that I have delivered to the Assembly, I have dwelt on the issue of climate change, especially as it fuels conflicts and complicates food security. Climate change reduces opportunity and prosperity, which in Africa, Latin America and some parts of Asia also contributes to transnational organized crime. Last year, as part of Nigeria’s effort to achieve our global net-zero aspirations, my Administration adopted\\na national climate-change strategy that aims to deliver climate-change mitigation in a sustainable manner. The measures we took at the national level also require climate justice. Compared to industrialized economies, Africa and other developing nations produce only a small proportion of greenhouse-gas emissions. Yet we are the hardest hit by the consequences of climate change, as we are seeing in the sustained drought in Somalia and the unprecedentedly severe floods in Pakistan. Those and other climate-related occurrences are now suddenly becoming commonplace in the developing world. In effect, we are literally paying the price for policies that others pursue. That must change.\\nAt the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Glasgow last year, I said that Nigeria was not asking for permission to make the same mistakes that others have made in creating the climate emergency. Fortunately, we now know what we can do to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis and the related energy challenges. As a first step, we must all commit to releasing the financing and the technology for creating a stable and affordable framework for energy transmission. Financial development institutions must prioritize de-risking energy projects to improve renewable projects’ access to credit facilities. No country should be left behind in that area. The skyrocketing energy costs worldwide are in part the product of conflict and supply disruptions to Europe and the Americas, yet we are all paying the price. It is therefore our expectation that the seventy- seventh session of the General Assembly and the upcoming COP 27 will help galvanize the political will required to drive action towards fulfilling the various existing climate change initiatives.\\nAnother feature of the past decade has been the growing partnerships between States and increasingly influential non-State actors. There was a time when the most important events at the Assembly featured statements by the world’s most powerful leaders. Now, a tweet or Instagram post by an influencer on a social or environmental issue may have a greater impact. Technology offers us limitless opportunities and sometimes runs ahead of the imagination of regulators and legislators. At its best, social media helps strengthen the foundation of our society and our common values. At its worst, it is a corrosive digital version of the mob, bristling with intolerance and division. In confronting those challenges, we must also come together to defend freedom of speech while upholding other values that we cherish. We must continue to work for a common standard that balances rights with responsibilities to keep the most vulnerable from harm and help strengthen and enrich communities. Efforts to protect communities from the scourge of disinformation and misinformation must also be matched with efforts to reduce inequalities and restore hope to the poorer and most vulnerable members of our communities, as a means to curb the many socioeconomic conflict drivers that we face.\\nIn spite of our efforts, humanitarian crises will continue to ravage some of our communities. Nigeria therefore implores its global partners to do more to complement its endeavours. Indeed, the multifaceted challenges facing most developing countries have left a debilitating chokehold on their fiscal space. That equally calls for addressing the burden of unsustainable external debt via a global commitment to the expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to countries facing fiscal and liquidity challenges, as well as outright cancellation for countries facing the most severe issues.\\nDemocracy is an idea that crosses time and borders. Sadly, it has its limitations. The wheels of democracy turn slowly. It can demand compromises that dilute decisions. Sometimes it bends too much to special interests that exercise influence, not always for the general good, in a manner disproportionate to their numbers. However, it has been my experience that a democratic culture provides a Government with the legitimacy it needs to deliver positive change. In Nigeria, not only have we worked to strengthen our democracy, but we have also supported it and promoted the rule of law in our subregion. In the Gambia, we helped guarantee the first democratic transition since independence. In Guinea-Bissau, we stood by the democratically elected Government when it faced mutiny. In Chad, following the tragic death on the battlefield of its President, the late Idriss Deby Itno, we joined forces with its other neighbours and international partners to stabilize the country and encourage a peaceful transition to democracy, a process that is ongoing. We believe in the sanctity of constitutional term limits, and we have steadfastly adhered to them in Nigeria. We have seen the corrosive impact on values when leaders elsewhere seek to change the rules to stay in power. Indeed, we are now preparing for general elections in Nigeria, scheduled for February. At the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, there will be a new face on this rostrum speaking for Nigeria.\\nOurs is a vast country, strengthened by its diversity and common values of hard work, enduring faith and a sense of community. We have invested heavily to strengthen our framework for free and fair elections, and I thank our partners for all the support that they have provided for our elections. As President, I have set the goal that one of the enduring legacies I would like to leave is to entrench a process of free, fair, transparent and credible elections by which Nigerians elect the leaders of their choice.\\nThe multiple challenges that we face are truly interconnected and urgent, and the choice of this session’s theme, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, is apt. In keeping with our obligations as Member States of the Organization, we must all do our utmost to work with the President to resolve them. In that regard, I reiterate my delegation’s full and resolute cooperation.\\nLet me convey my final reflections from this famous rostrum. We live in extraordinary times, with interdependent challenges, but enormous opportunities. The pace of change can seem bewildering, with sometimes a palpable and unsettling sense of uncertainty about our future. But if my years in public service have taught me anything, it is that we must keep faith with those values that endure. They include, but are not limited to, such values as justice, honour, integrity, ceaseless endeavour and partnership within and between nations.

Whipps Jr., and the people of Palau.\\nIt is a great pleasure to be able to address the General Assembly and, at the outset, I wish to congratulate the President of the Assembly at its seventy-seventh session, Mr. Csaba Korosi, and pledge Palau’s support\\nduring the course of his term. I also wish to thank the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, a fellow islander — from Maldives — who was gracious enough to take the long journey to Palau during his term, Honourable Minister Abdulla Shahid, for his astute leadership over the course of the last year.\\nWe meet at a precarious time. Thankfully, the world has made great strides in collectively combating the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The people of Palau thank all our international partners and friends who came to our aid during this difficult time, particularly the United States, Japan, Taiwan, Australia and others. The collaboration was successful in minimizing the impact of the pandemic in our small and vulnerable community.\\nRegrettably, while the world made great progress in pandemic recovery, new and unprecedented challenges have emerged. The war in Ukraine rages on, causing damage to infrastructure, homes, schools and cultural sites, killing innocent people and terrorizing the children of the country. Palau continues to strongly condemn the war in Ukraine and joins the international community in calling for Russia to withdraw from Ukraine’s sovereign territory. We also extend our prayers to and solidarity with the people of Ukraine.\\nWhile war may be viewed as a heart attack, the climate crisis has been like diabetes — insidious and wearing us down constantly and consistently year after year. I would like to take this opportunity to join fellow leaders to express my country’s deepest sympathy with our brothers and sisters in Pakistan and those impacted by Hurricane Fiona with respect to the awful climate devastation they have experienced. These catastrophes represent the unfortunate “new normal” for many in small island developing States.\\nClimate change is not only about hurricanes and floods. It is about droughts. It is about wildfires. It is about our ability to provide drinking water and feed our people when our lakes run dry and our aquaculture facilities and reefs are ravaged by typhoons. We face all of these challenges and more in Palau today. Our Government’s inability to buy our children new textbooks or improve their nutrition programmes is because so many of our fiscal resources and energy are dedicated to addressing disaster relief. How many times do the people of our island of Kayangel have to rebuild their homes from storms before they give up?\\nHow many times, Mr. President, does your home have to be swept away before it breaks your spirit?\\nDespite the challenges of this last year, we have begun to see glimmers of hope in the fight against climate change. Youth, the private sector and civil service are more engaged than ever. Over 150,000 young people went up to Glasgow for the twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and provided much-needed pressure for leaders to take action, and after four failed Conferences of the Parties, the Glasgow Climate Pact was finally adopted. Even major emitting countries like the United States and Australia have finally passed significant legislation to shift their domestic policies. None of these efforts get us to 1.5°C yet, but they represent a great step forward, and we commend their efforts.\\nAs the Russian-driven energy crisis has shown us, energy independence and renewable energy sources build resilience into our economies. Palau has felt the strain of skyrocketing energy costs, which is fuelling our ambition to achieve a 100 per cent transition to renewable energy. In Palau, we have a saying “Sel om tobed el mora buai, em chisngekl mesa blimT Translated, it is like the English saying, “people who live in glass houses should not throw stones”, meaning that before criticizing other people’s actions, one must look at one’s own.\\nIt is in this spirit that our President, Mr. Surangel Whipps Jr., has committed to Palau making the transition to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2032. The message that we want to convey is clear: despite our small size, our remote location, our lack of access to financing and technology and the unique vulnerabilities of being a small island developing State (SIDS), we are committed to moving towards a net-zero carbon world. We are committed because our planet and our children need us all to be committed.\\nPalau extends its sincere thanks to the Government of Japan, which has committed a grant to help us update our country’s power grid to allow for the transition to renewables. We are grateful for Japan’s continued friendship and support.\\nOur small country had the pleasure of hosting the seventh Our Ocean Conference, together with the United States, in April of this year. The conference brought together more than 600 participants, representing more than 70 foreign delegations and 150 non-State actors. It\\nconcluded with 410 commitments, worth $16.35 billion. As a SIDS, we thought that it was particularly important to bring people from all over the world to Palau to show them first-hand the challenges that we face as SIDS, whether it is plastic pollution, sea level rise or the impact on our fragile corals, which underpin our major economic driver of blue tourism. The conference also highlighted the importance of ocean-based climate solutions, including shipping decarbonization, marine nature-based solutions and offshore renewable energy, in keeping the 1.5°C global warming target within reach and improving global climate resilience.\\nWe are incredibly grateful for the wonderful partnership of the United States in co-hosting the Our Ocean Conference, which was a success due, in large part, to its camaraderie and efforts. We also thank the Republic of China-Taiwan for its generosity and support in upgrading our conference venues. Likewise, we thank our partner Japan and the Sasakawa Foundation for their generosity and significant technical support. Many other partners also contributed to make the event a success for climate action.\\nAs a blue ocean State, Palau has been the leader in oceans issues, and we will continue to be. As co-Chair of the High-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy with Norway, we are pleased to have recently welcomed the United Kingdom as our seventeenth member of the ocean panel, and we are committed to working with it and all panel members to achieve 100 per cent ocean management for a sustainable ocean economy, in which effective protection, sustainable production and equitable prosperity go hand in hand. Palau believes in the 30 by 30 initiative, and we urge all Member States to adopt management plans with a minimum marine protected area covering 30 per cent of the exclusive economic zone.\\nAs a large ocean State, we do not believe that there is a sustainable solution to ocean issues without incorporating management and rules in the high seas. The Pacific is disappointed that the efforts of the fifth session of the Intergovernmental Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction could not conclude a treaty text, as the preservation and fair and equitable sharing of benefits of biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction is long overdue as an extension of the world’s commitment to combating climate change. The opportunity to establish regional marine protected areas, build more maritime surveillance capacity and facilitate the transfer of marine technology should not be further delayed. We owe it to our future generations to come together for the sustainable use of humankind’s common heritage.\\nPalau is a champion of the moratorium on deep- sea mining. The deep sea makes up 90 per cent of the marine environment, and we cannot allow great harm to come to such biologically rich areas. Before any nation is allowed to contract for deep-sea mining projects, the global community must enact serious reform of the International Seabed Authority and international regulations that comply with the mission of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to preserve and protect the marine environment.\\nLet me now turn to an issue that deeply impacts both Palau and SIDS. The adoption of a multidimensional vulnerability index cannot be discussed only in financial board rooms, for it has real impacts on the lives of island peoples. The multidimensional vulnerability index analysis by the United Nations Development Programme found that most SIDS are more vulnerable than their income level would suggest. We do not come here as a proud people asking for handouts. However, we need tailored solutions for our problems as small countries and meaningful access to financing. The adoption of the multidimensional vulnerability index facilitates climate action and can bring equity to global financing.\\nAs members should know, we have a Compact of Free Association agreement with the United States. In doing so, our people signal that we have shared values with the United States. The United States also promised to help provide for our development needs after Palau gained independence from it. Since the time our Compact was signed, however, some development has occurred, but it is too little. Our economy has not grown sufficiently and is fragile, as demonstrated by a contraction of more than 30 per cent during the past five years. Much of that is due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but some to geopolitics. We should not be so vulnerable. We have been forced to borrow more than we should have to, and we lack essential infrastructure.\\nA strength of our association is that it requires the Governments of Palau and the United States to periodically reconsider the relationship and its terms and review Palau’s requirements for assistance for public services and economic development, and it commits both of our Governments to act on the conclusions.\\nThe United States has initiated the required thirtieth anniversary review. Its bureaucracy initially proposed unacceptably inadequate assistance, but President Biden appointed an envoy who, we trust, will get his Government to at least meet Palau’s minimum needs so that our people can attain a decent standard of living without having to leave. That is essential to enabling the relationship to endure, as my Government envisions. It hopes that, when we next address the General Assembly, we will be able to report an agreement in that regard. We need greater financial and programmatic assistance and will require those for the foreseeable future and for as long as free association continues. But what we want most are Government measures and public and private investment to grow our economy.\\nWe are deeply grateful for the assistance that the United States and other Governments, such as Taiwan and Japan, have provided, but we need more now, just as we need measures to combat and adapt to climate change’s rising seas. In our case, that includes concrete action to enable our people, and, right now, especially our hospital, to move from land that now regularly floods to a higher-elevation area.\\nWe continue to view the United Nations as an important mechanism for achieving international peace and security and sustainable development for all countries, but, in particular, for the voiceless and the most vulnerable.\\nI reiterate in the strongest terms that this organ can demonstrate leadership by accepting Taiwan into the United Nations system as a valuable contributor to our collective efforts to promote peace and collaborate on international matters. Most States Members of the United Nations accept Taiwan passports; so, too, should the United Nations system recognize and incorporate the Taiwanese people and enrich this organ with the benefits of their participation. Doing so is a realization of the core principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The Taiwanese people are part of the global community and a valuable partner in combating climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. With the many challenges facing our planet and people, we need every person, including the 23 million people of Taiwan, to be part of the solutions.\\nWhen linguists studied our local Palauan language, they discovered that it was anchored in the word “heart”; beltik er reng, which translates as “found heart”, means love. We are a people and a culture who navigate with our hearts, and that is the message that I would like to leave Member States with today. Palau chooses love of self, love of neighbour, love of planet and love as a virtue. We believe that choosing love is our only way forward for collective peace and prosperity.\\nThere is no profit sufficiently large to be worth the price of war or the destruction of our planet. Above all the highs and lows of this year, I trust that this institution will take away the importance of unity and respect for the rule of law. We are capable of overcoming the immense challenges of our time, but we must do so together.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'un/TXT/Session 77 - 2022/KEN_77_2022.txt'}, page_content='I am grateful for the immense privilege of joining everyone here in the General Assembly — a privilege made possible by the peaceful democratic transition that followed the free and fair elections held in Kenya on 9 August. Those elections stand as a testimony of the universal power of democracy, as well as the manifest ability of African peoples to invest in stronger nations and a secure future by using robust institutions, effective constitutions and the impartial administration of the rule of law to guarantee the realization of our shared objectives.\\nThe General Assembly’s seventy-seventh session comes at a unique moment, as the entire world struggles with multiple grave challenges, including regional conflicts, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the triple planetary crisis, food insecurity and the rising cost of living.\\nI take this opportunity to congratulate the President on his election and to express my confidence that his wealth of experience offers us significant assurance of his good leadership. The motto of his presidency, “Solutions through solidarity, sustainability and science”, succinctly captures with particular resonance the urgent imperatives of our time. I assure the President of Kenya’s firm support and cooperation during his tenure.\\nI also take this opportunity to commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his bold steps in steering the United Nations community and for ensuring its business continuity under the unprecedented circumstances occasioned by multiple global threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nHuman well-being is under grave threat. The health of the planet requires urgent attention. The immense pressure exerted by conventional threats, such as climate change, the global food crisis, terrorism, cybercrime and armed conflict, has been compounded by the unprecedented and devastating disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. I express my approval of the President’s theme for this year’s session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, because it boldly signals the window of opportunity that we now have to step up our engagement from firm consensus to decisive action.\\nIn many respects, the COVID-19 pandemic stripped us of many illusions and exposed stark justice and solidarity deficits in the face of existential crisis. It brought into sharp focus the global economy’s two- lane highway, repressively patrolled by a rising tide of exclusionist nationalism — a spectre that undermines prospects for collective action and significantly impairs the resolve of the international community to guarantee the fundamental rights, including the rights to safety and dignity, of the world’s vulnerable majority.\\nIt is also for that reason that many nations, especially in the global South, now advocate the democratization of global governance and a reimagined multilateralism that is inclusive and works for the good of all. Kenya stands ready to work with other nations to achieve the\\npan-Africanization of multilateralism and a more just and inclusive system of global governance.\\nIt is important to reflect on those matters as we do our best to get our people, enterprises and industries back on their feet so that the engine of development can power our societies towards a prosperity that actually leaves no one behind. “Building back better” is the universal rallying call to incorporate lessons learned into doing more, in a better way, to recover from shocks. I would suggest that we have a golden opportunity to faithfully adhere to that motto by augmenting it, in word and in deed, with an additional “b” to make it “building back better from the bottom”.\\nBuilding back better from the bottom upwards is essentially about including the marginalized working majority in the economic mainstream. The bottom millions relentlessly wage their daily battle for survival in a crowded arena that is characterized by scarcity of opportunity and a generally precarious existence. The ingenuity, optimism, resilience and energy demonstrated by those in that ever-bustling bottom segment is sometimes called hustling.\\nInvisible to policymakers and beyond the reach of many public services, those hustlers take nothing for granted, surviving overwhelming odds and frequently achieving great success. In the words of Abraham Lincoln, things may come to those who wait, but only the things left behind by those who hustle. It is time to bolster the resilience of our nations to mainstream those millions through deliberate strategies and efforts to advance economic inclusion by building back better from the bottom.\\nThe interlocking challenges of conflicts, the triple planetary crisis and the global food crisis have impeded our momentum and obstructed our focus in achieving fundamental transformations towards sustainable development. In the Horn of Africa region, severe drought and the disruption of supply chains due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have left us food-insecure. Consequently, we have been constrained to repurpose our strategies to prioritize drought and famine relief to insulate education from disruption and improve social protection and health-care systems in order ensure people’s well-being.\\nMany countries now bear witness to the unsettling phenomena of rivers, canals and water reservoirs drying up owing to droughts and heat waves occasioned by climate change. Kenya is no exception. The northern, arid and semi-arid rangelands of our country have been gravely impacted by drought whose severity has not been experienced in 40 years. The scarce rainfall over three consecutive seasons has led to poor crops and pasture, leaving some 3.1 million residents of those rangelands severely food insecure. That unprecedented confluence of intensely adverse events has exacerbated water scarcity and starvation, which are worsened by rising food prices, thereby complicating Kenya’s road map towards delivering a good quality of life to its citizens and hindering our progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals 6 and 2.\\nSevere drought has affected not only the Horn of Africa and the Sahel regions; it also continues to devastate many others, including in Asia, Europe and the Americas. If for no other reason, the fact that we are in this together must strengthen the case for concerted efforts across the continents. With that in mind, I call on Member States and all relevant stakeholders to demonstrate strong political will and showcase effective cooperation by supporting the most affected countries both financially and by sharing land-restoration and climate-adaptation technologies. Collaborating to expand inclusion can usher in a new paradigm of multilateralism for us.\\nThe latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reminds us that we cannot afford to waste another moment debating the merits of doing something versus doing nothing. It will soon be too late to reverse the course of events, and then, even the best possible interventions will not suffice. Every day is an opportunity for us as leaders to expedite our efforts to confront the triple planetary crisis.\\nIt should be recalled that during the Stockholm+50 meeting, which Kenya had the honour of co-hosting with Sweden, there was agreement among States on the need to act urgently to address environmental impacts. Given that consensus, it is deeply concerning that little progress has been made with regard to the action that is needed. It is time to collectively contemplate the urgent measures needed to implement the high- priority actions we must take in order to contain the ongoing disruptions, as well as deliberate on longterm implementation approaches to be undertaken. I fully agree with the Secretary-General’s memorable statement, that “[w]e have a rendezvous with climate disaster” (A/77/PV.4, p.3). I add that we must not be taken by surprise. If being forewarned indeed means\\nbeing forearmed, this is our opportunity to mobilize with tremendous urgency and take action at once.\\nThe agricultural sector has an important part to play in reducing the severity of climate change. A number of practices have a bearing, positive or negative, on various dimensions of the environment. Investing in modern agricultural technology is therefore one important avenue towards tackling prevailing environmental challenges. Kenya is responding through substantial investment in climate-resilient agriculture. At the core of our 10-year strategy for agricultural-sector growth and transformation are nine flagships. They include the registration of farmers to direct incentives, improving farmer practices through customized extension services, the monitoring of emergency food-reserve stocks using a digital food balance sheet and the use of an early-warning system to monitor food supplies and market prices.\\nAgriculture remains the bedrock of the development of many nations and will therefore continue to hold the key to ensuring equitable and sustainable growth for our people. No country, large or small, has ever attained significant growth without modernizing its agricultural sector. And as we rededicate ourselves to those targets, we must, in the immediate term, find answers to the severe deficit in the availability, flow and accessibility of fertilizer to our farmers worldwide. I could not agree more with Secretary-General Guterres’ warning in this Hall yesterday, that\\n“Without action now, the global fertilizer shortage will quickly morph into a global food shortage” (ibid., p. 2).\\nWe are encouraged to note that education, health, agriculture and numerous other public services have become increasingly reliant on digital access. The world needs greater investment in the development of information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure, accompanied by policies that support innovation and increased acquisition and deployment of technology. In so doing, we should be driven by the conviction that those measures offer a viable shortcut to poverty reduction and the promotion of inclusive development. I call for stronger global partnerships to enhance ICT infrastructure in developing countries and bridge the yawning digital divide between the global South and the rest of the world.\\nThe General Assembly’s seventy-seventh session follows the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), UNEP@50, as well as Stockholm+50 and the Ocean Conference in Lisbon. The outcomes of those conferences demanded real commitment to addressing global environmental concerns as a matter of urgency and a just transition to sustainable economies that work for all people.\\nThe fifth United Nations Environment Assembly’s adoption in Nairobi of the March 2022 landmark resolution to end plastic pollution is a decisive signal that the world is prepared and motivated to act to address that menace. Kenya is committed to working closely with other nations to pursue legally binding instruments aimed at bringing an end to plastic pollution. As the host nation to UNEP and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, Kenya affirms that those critical United Nations agencies have an indispensable role in the promotion of environmental sustainability globally, as well as in developing socially and environmentally sound sustainable cities.\\nIn keeping with its strong commitment to multilateral institutions, Kenya has made more land available for the United Nations Office in Nairobi (UNON) to facilitate the upgrading of its complex. I take this opportunity to call on Member States to complement that contribution through enhanced financing aimed at adequately modernizing the UNON facilities Nairobi.\\nKenya remains a strong advocate for making the sustainable use of ocean and blue-economy resources a development priority, holding the firm belief that significantly increased investment in that essential sector can end hunger, reduce poverty, create jobs and spur economic growth. I urge the Secretary-General to continue calling attention to the urgent need to develop that vital sector. In particular, I call on developed countries to invest in sustainable fishing, protect marine ecosystems and share ocean-based climate solutions with developing countries.\\nFor our part, I am pleased to report that, building on the historic 2018 Sustainable Blue Economy Conference, held in Nairobi, Kenya is reviewing its national blue-economy strategy in order to strengthen community structures in the participatory management of freshwater, coastal and marine resources and ecosystems. The strategy is expected to contribute to our economic development through food and\\nnutrition security, coastal and rural development and income increases along the aquaculture value chains.\\nIt will also enhance maritime transport and tourism. We invite development partnerships to invest in Africa towards building the capacity to sustainably utilize marine resources. We must rally together to make the best use of Africa’s vast blue resources in developing our economies while meeting our climate targets.\\nAs we look forward to the twenty-seventh Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt, it is logical to expect that Member States will shift their attention towards the development and implementation of frameworks for climate change mitigation. Member States must complete their pending actions so they can turn to the implementation work that lies ahead. I therefore call on all of us to urgently deliver on all commitments made towards climate-change financing. It is critical to emphasize that we are running out of time in that regard.\\nOver the past decade, Kenya has sustained its aggressive pursuit of rapid socioeconomic transformation through three principal road maps. The first road map is the Kenya National Vision 2030, the formal long-term blueprint aimed at transforming Kenya into a newly industrializing, upper-middle-income country providing a high quality of life to all its citizens in a clean and secure environment by 2030. The second road map is the African Union’s Agenda 2063. The third road map is the Sustainable Development Goals. Kenya seeks to tap into a variety of resources to catalyse the achievement of those interlocking and mutually reinforcing objectives.\\nThe disruption and ensuing crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic compelled us to diversify our focus into new interventions, including an economic stimulus programme, a COVID-19 economic recovery strategy and a COVID-19 socioeconomic re-engineering recovery strategy, all aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of the pandemic. I confirm that we have done our utmost in the circumstances. Nevertheless, it is not enough. Kenya and the rest of Africa, like other developing countries, are in need of greater international partnership and cooperation to avert economic crisis in the wake of the pandemic.\\nDeveloping countries, which are heavily burdened by external-debt servicing, run the risk of losing development gains because of the shocks inflicted by the pandemic and associated disruptions. I call on global financial institutions and the international community to take urgent steps to release all existing financial instruments in order to provide much-needed additional liquidity and secure better fiscal space for developing countries such as Kenya to enhance social investment, support climate change adaptation and mitigation, address security needs and resolve development financing challenges.\\nOn behalf of Kenya, I therefore join other leaders in calling on the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders to extend pandemic- related debt relief to the worst-hit countries, especially those affected by the devastating combination of conflict, climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. I also urge the Group of 20 to extend and expand the scope of the common framework to suspend or reschedule debt repayments by middle-income countries during the pandemic recovery period.\\nI would like the Assembly to take a moment to consider the peace and security landscape — one that is currently beset with multiple challenges but also abounds with considerable opportunities. Our home region of East Africa and the Horn of Africa, in particular, is burdened by significant conflicts and challenges that have implications for the region’s development. We stand on the cusp of a vast opportunity to galvanize confidence-building measures in order to generate and sustain momentum towards sustainable peace.\\nIn its role as an anchor State in the region, Kenya has sustained our investment in diplomatic efforts to find lasting peace in multiple situations within and beyond the region. Although some processes have yielded undeniable success, challenges remain. I therefore strongly reiterate our call for partnership towards confidence-building measures and urge more concerted efforts to achieve sustainable peace and stability.\\nKenya is currently serving on the Security Council. I am proud to confirm that our engagement over the past two years has prioritized regional peace and security, countering terrorism and violent extremism, peace support operations and climate and security as critical contributions to collective efforts to build a safer, more prosperous and peaceful world. I am also proud to state that Kenya has continued to champion closer cooperation between regional mechanisms and the Security Council as an effective means for achieving international peace and security.\\nKenya continues to advocate the renewal of the African Union Peace and Security Architecture, which draws comparative strength from the highly productive complementarity among the United Nations, the African Union and the regional economic communities. Working closely with the other two elected African members of the Security Council, we are committed to finding a stronger African voice in the Council and achieving a consensus-driven, rules-based multilateral system. It is our manifest intention to see greater pan- Africanization of the global agenda in order to make multilateralism work for the people of the world in their diversity. It is time for multilateralism to reflect the voices of the farmers, represent the hopes of villagers, champion the aspirations of pastoralists, defend the rights of fisherfolk, express the dreams of traders, respect the wishes of workers and indeed protect the welfare of all the peoples of the global South.\\nLet me express my country’s strong collective conviction that the relevance, legitimacy and moral authority of the United Nations will forever remain deficient and undermined in the absence of comprehensive reforms of the Security Council. We therefore remain firmly committed to reforming the Security Council to make it a more effective, representative and democratic global institution.\\nGiven the magnitude and variety of challenges the world continues to confront, a more fit-for-purpose United Nations is urgently needed, one that possesses the legitimacy and efficacy required to deal with threats to international peace and security. A just and inclusive world order cannot be spearheaded by a Security Council that persistently and unjustly fails the inclusivity criterion. Similarly, threats to democracy will not be credibly resolved by an undemocratic and unrepresentative Security Council. It is vitally important for that critical institution to reflect the values it is entrusted to protect, defend and uphold on behalf of humankind. We welcome the call by President Biden this morning for the expansion of the membership of the Security Council as a significant step in the right direction and look forward to building consensus towards realizing that.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted health systems, thereby seriously challenging the implementation of programmes that are vital for the realization of the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To place us firmly back on track and accelerate our progress towards the SDG targets, it is imperative for us to foster sustainable partnerships among Governments, other State actors, civil society and the private sector. That modality of collective action is particularly vital for building resilient health systems, whose importance in enabling us to withstand future pandemics and other health crises can no longer be disputed.\\nFor that reason, Kenya will continue to strongly support the development of legally binding World Health Organization international instruments in order to anchor global solidarity and promote equity. The fact is that the COVID-19 pandemic exposed, for all the world to see, the severe deficit of those critical values in our current multilateral configuration.\\nGlobal supply chains remained impervious to demand in the global South generally and to Africa in particular. Unequal access to vaccines underscored that unjust and unequal situation, with unforgettable clarity. Whenever human life, security and welfare are in jeopardy, it is immoral to administer interventions through frameworks that are anchored on fundamental inequality. We are all witnesses to admirable demonstrations of effective solidarity in response to crises in various parts of the world. Our knowledge of the possibility of spontaneous, yet resolute, global solidarity reinforces the African exception as particularly repugnant.\\nFrom genocides and civil conflict to famine and pandemics, the African continent is consistently left behind to bear the brunt of weak solidarity and the disastrous failure of multilateralism. History indicates that the last time that Africa was the focal point of strong and effective multilateral consensus was during the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, and the character of the ensuing interventions casts a long shadow to date.\\nNot to put too fine a point on it, but the failure of multilateralism during crises, which relegates the people of Africa outside the circle of moral consideration and normalizes humanitarian neglect and other casual injustices, is a failure of humankind. Nothing about Africa — I repeat, nothing about Africa or its peoples — makes it acceptable for that type of failure to persist in this era, and we have an urgent moral duty to do better and right that wrong.\\nFor decades, Africa has borne the brunt of three epidemics — HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. I applaud innovative partnerships such as the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria for their progress in addressing the three menaces. I also welcome the ambitious targets set for the seventh replenishment cycle. Kenya is committed to supporting the Global Fund and implementing agreed targets in order to actualize our pledge at the Replenishment Conference. Kenya calls upon all countries implementing the Global Fund programmes, especially fellow African States, to remain at the forefront in championing the successful replenishment of the Fund. In that way, the mobilization of much-needed resources will be enhanced, thereby bringing us closer to the elimination of those dangerous diseases.\\nIn conclusion, Kenya joins the Secretary-General in calling for the strengthening of multilateralism as the only sustainable path to a peaceful, stable and prosperous world for all. That is the imperative of our time and the call of this moment. It is time to work on the trust deficit with stronger conviction that none of us is really safe until all of us are safe.\\nThe theme of the seventy-seventh session, “A watershed moment:\\ttransformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, demands that we recognize that the crises we must confront are interlinked in a complicated way. They can be effectively addressed only through more imaginative strategies and innovative formulas. A population of 8 billion people, in a densely networked world, increasingly looks up to the multilateral system as the anchor of their individual aspirations, both directly and indirectly through robust national frameworks. Therefore, the United Nations system is increasingly expected to be responsive to those needs, and the proceedings in forums such as the General Assembly are expected to speak to ordinary people in the far-flung reaches of our incredibly diverse globe.\\nIt is impossible to address all their individual needs directly, but it is possible to respond to all of them by speaking with conviction to the universal values of equality, inclusion, justice, solidarity and collective action, while making sure that all our interventions effectively reflect them, with clarity. The integrity of the international order must be measured by the distance separating our resolutions, consensus and agreement from decisive actions, committed interventions and effective solutions. A watershed moment therefore demands that we reduce that gap drastically and quickly.\\nKenya pursues numerous essential domestic agendas through the multilateral framework. We are heavily invested in the strength, effectiveness and eventual success of all the interventions formulated by the United Nations. It is important that the output of this forum and other similar forums achieve immediate resonance in the minds and lives of our young people, who still seek the opportunity to express and actualize themselves; our farmers, who work to feed our nations; our jua kali entrepreneurs, who strive in pursuit of success in the informal economy; and our professionals, who formulate policy, implement strategy and monitor service delivery in the public and private sectors.\\nAfrica places immense value on the international community and the tremendous possibilities it can unlock through inclusive, sustainable and effective action to transform the lives of our peoples and establish lasting peace, security and shared prosperity. This watershed moment is our chance to turn the key and open that door of opportunity. We can make progress in addressing the triple global threats and liberate ourselves from the shame of the past failures of multilateralism. At this watershed moment, we must not only choose but also act decisively to bequeath to our children and their children a greener, safer, healthier and more abundant Earth. Let us do it together — inclusively and multilaterally.')]"
